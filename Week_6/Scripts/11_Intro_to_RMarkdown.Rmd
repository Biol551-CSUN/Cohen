# 1. What is RMarkdown?
what's inside

# 2. RMarkdown metadata and outputs
Metadata: YAML

# 3. Basic Markdown text
install packages in the console  
install.packages("rmarkdown")  
install.packages('tinytex')  

## Headers
these are used to create the table of contents  
use the # to add headers  
the more # used will change the header level  

## Bold
can use ** or __ before and after the text want to bold  
EXs:  
**text to bold**  
__text to bold__  

## Italics
use one * or _ before and after the text want to make italic  
EXs:
*italic text*
_italic text_

## add new line
to write on the next line must end the previous line with two spaces  

## Lists
bulleted lists use -  
and you must put an empty line before the list 

EX:  

- item 1  
- item 2  
- item 3   

numbered list use normal syntax  
EX:  
1. Item 1  
2. Item 2  
3. Item 3  

## Images
use syntax 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
![image caption](link)
```

# 4. Using code chunks
You can control what you want printed in the html within the code chunks  

## Chunk options
displayed inside the {} and after r,  

* `incude = FASLE`  prevents code and results from appearing in file  
* `echo = FALSE`    prevents code from appearing in file

## Global options
set options for entire file  
at begining of file add
```{r, eval=FALSE}
kintr::opts_chunk$set
```
anything passed here will be applied to entire document  
EX:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
kintr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,  
                      warning = FALSE)
```
